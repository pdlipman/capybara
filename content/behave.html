                <h3>How Capybaras Eat</h3>
                <p>
                    Capybaras use their long, sharp teeth for grazing on grass and water plants. An adult capy can eat 6 to 8 pounds (2.7 to 3.6 kilograms) of grass per day! During the dry season, when fresh grasses and water plants dry up, capybaras eat reeds, grains, melons, and squashes.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Defense</h3>
                <p>
                    Capybaras protect themselves from predatorsWhat does predators mean? by diving into the nearest body of water and hiding. Their enemies include large snakes such as the anaconda, jaguars, ocelots, pumas, the harpy eagle, and humans, who will eat them if they can catch them, and use their hides to make leather.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Sleeping</h3>
                <p>Capybaras, also called water hogs, sleep along the water source in dense vegetation to hide from predators and to keep cool. Sometimes capybaras will nap in mud or shallow water, as well. </p>
                <p>If necessary, Capybaras are even able to sleep underwater. They keep just their noses above water so they can breathe.</p>

      <li>Greatly enlarged scent glands on top of snout in male signals status &amp; may attract females

<li>Amount of scent-marking correlates with dominance rank
</ul>


<p><strong>Vocalization</strong></p>

      <li>Infants and young constantly emit a guttural  purr, perhaps to stay in touch with group; losers in aggressive matches also make this  sound in appeasement
      <li>Low clicking sounds of contentment
      <li>Sharp prolonged  whistles, squeals, short grunts
      <li>Alarm bark or cough
      <li>Most warning calls come from subordinate males in a group; companions react by standing alert or plunging into nearest water       <li>Females emit a whistle when in estrus
      <li>Males tooth-chatter as sign of aggression
      <li>Many other closely related species also highly vocal, especially guinea pigs and cavies<br><br>
  </ul>
   <b>	Olfaction/Scent Marking</b>
   <ul>
      <li>Both sexes scent mark with anal gland; females less frequently</li>
      <li>Group members may recognize each other by their unique mix of scent chemicals<br><br>
     </li>
